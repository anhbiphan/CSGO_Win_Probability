## Project Presentation:


### Project Details:
This project consist of rating and ranking teams.
Predicting win probabilities for teams.
Predicting which team will win.


#### Goals  
- The goal of the project is to have a accurate win probability that will allow the model to predict the winner of a match.

#### Problems:
- Some teams are currently not active.
- Team members may have switched to different teams. 
- COVID-19 has prevented a tournament environment for teams to play in.
- Having fans maybe help or harm some teams. (similar to home team advantages)

#### Solutions:
- Collect only active teams
- Account for player skills
- Obtain team win/lose on maps

#### Recommendations for further developments:
- Have an updated team rating based on player rating
- Include in-game weapon skills of players
- Averaging player skills and applying to team rating
- Account for players switching to diff. teams and updating team rating
- Improve model.
